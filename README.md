Randomizer
==========

Ever had one of those evenings where you just can't decide what to do. Or you and the other half can't agree on the same thing.

Need someone to step in before it turns into a full on battle...enter the randomizer.

A super simple angular app that allows you to enter all your choices and it will tell you what you are doing.

Use it here: [http://randomizer.designyourcode.io](http://randomizer.designyourcode.io){:target="_blank"}


To Download and Run
===================

Simply clone the project.

Run `npm install` and then run `gulp`.

Gulp is used to compile SASS, set up a local server, provide live reload support and concatinate/minify the javascript.

**Note: This project is built in AngularJS**

Feedback
